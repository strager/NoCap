= Prerequisites =

== Execution requirements ==

NoCap requires the full profile of the .NET 4.0 framework.

NoCap depends upon WPF, MEF (built into .NET 4.0), WinForms, some Windows
P/Invoke API's, and GDI.NET.

All other binary dependencies should be included in NoCap.

== Building requirements ==

NoCap is developed with MSVS2010.  It is known to compile with the following
software:

 * Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Professional

NoCap *may* compile with the following software:

 * MSBuild (vanilla)
 * Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (other versions)
 * Microsoft Visual Studio 2008

NoCap's MSBuild scripts use the <Zip> command from MSBuild Community Tasks.
That task can be downloaded at: http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/.

dotNetInstaller is used to create the bootstrapper to install dependencies
needed for NoCap when installing for an end-user.  The binaries needed for
dotNetInstaller are included in /vendor/dotNetInstaller, and dotNetInstaller
does not need to be installed separately.

= Building =

NoCap should build out of the box.  (If you have any problems, file a ticket or
otherwise contact the NoCap development team.)

The NoCap GUI will be built into the /NoCap.GUI.WPF/bin/$$$/ directory.

The core NoCap installer will be built into the /NoCap.Installer/bin/$$$/
directory.  The bootstrapping installer is located at
/NoCap.Installer/bin/$$$/NoCapSetup.exe.

= Testing =

NUnit unit tests are available in the Test subnamespaces of several projects.
These unit tests should not fail on any commit; if some do, file a ticket or
contact the development team.

= Creating extensions =

See /NoCap.Extensions.Default/ for an example.

TODO Document this further.
